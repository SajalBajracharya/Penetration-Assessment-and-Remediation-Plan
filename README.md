# Penetration-Assessment-and-Remediation-Plan

## Objective
To evaluate Artemis Inc.'s IT infrastructure for potential vulnerabilities, including network devices, web applications, and cloud services. The project aimed to identify security gaps, assess risks, and prioritize remediation strategies. This work enhances the organization's ability to prevent cyber threats, protect sensitive data, and maintain operational resilience.

### Skills Learned

- Reconnaissance: Identifying publicly accessible information using tools like Google, LinkedIn, and Shodan.
- Vulnerability Analysis: Using tools like Nessus, Invicti, and Burp Suite to detect vulnerabilities.
- Risk Assessment: Prioritizing vulnerabilities based on risk impact and likelihood.
- Remediation Planning: Developing actionable strategies to mitigate identified risks.

### Tools Used
- Reconnaissance: Google Search, Shodan, LinkedIn, WHOIS Lookup.
- Scanning and Enumeration: Nmap, Masscan, Angry IP Scanner, Netdiscover.
- Vulnerability Assessment: Nessus, OpenVAS, Invicti, Burp Suite, Arachni.
- Threat Analysis: Maltego, Mitaka.

## Steps
1. Reconnaissance: Collected information on Artemisâ€™s systems, users, and technology stack using OSINT techniques.
2. Scanning: Performed network and system scans to discover live hosts and open ports.
3. Vulnerability Assessment: Identified vulnerabilities in web applications, servers, and network devices using automated tools.
4. Threat Analysis: Analyzed potential exploitation scenarios for identified vulnerabilities.
5. Recommendations: Compiled detailed remediation strategies tailored to each vulnerability.
6. Reporting: Delivered a comprehensive report outlining findings, risks, and mitigation steps.
